Oasis Infobyte – Security Analyst Internship

This repository documents the practical tasks and research work completed during the
Security Analyst Internship at Oasis Infobyte. The internship focuses on foundational
cybersecurity concepts, hands-on security testing, and security awareness research.

Internship Tasks

1. Basic Network Scanning with Nmap
Performed network reconnaissance to identify live hosts, open ports, running services,
and basic system information using Nmap. The task focuses on understanding network
exposure and attack surfaces.

2. Basic Firewall Configuration with UFW
Configured and managed firewall rules using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to allow and
deny network traffic. This task demonstrates basic network defense and access control.

3. SQL Injection on DVWA (Low Security)
Performed SQL Injection attacks on the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) in a
controlled lab environment with low security settings to understand web application
vulnerabilities and attack techniques.

4. Research Report on Common Network Security Threats
Conducted research on common network security threats such as malware, DoS attacks,
man-in-the-middle attacks, and unauthorized access, including their impact and
mitigation strategies.

5. Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks
Researched social engineering techniques including phishing, pretexting, baiting,
and tailgating, focusing on how attackers exploit human behavior and how organizations
can defend against such attacks.

6. Research Report on the Importance of Patch Management
Analyzed the role of patch management in cybersecurity, including risks of unpatched
systems, vulnerability exploitation, and best practices for maintaining secure systems.

7. Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto
Performed web server vulnerability scanning using Nikto to identify misconfigurations,
outdated software, and potential security issues.

8. Capture Network Traffic with Wireshark
Captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark to understand protocols,
packet structures, and identify suspicious or abnormal network activity.

Basic Network Scanning with Nmap
Objective

The objective of this task is to perform basic network reconnaissance using Nmap (Network Mapper). Network scanning helps identify live hosts, open ports, running services, and potential attack surfaces within a network. This task builds foundational skills required for security monitoring and vulnerability assessment in a SOC environment.
